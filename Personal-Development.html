                                    withing the given time limit, I always ensure that I start them as soon as they are given, thus allowing me to compplete them before the deadline. In addition to <br>
                                    school, I'm also affiliated with several other institutions. As a result, I usually have a lot of deadlines to meet for projects, plans and meetings. To effectivly <br>

                                    Who am I around? What effect are they having on me? What have they got me reading? What have they got me saying? Where do they have me going? What do they have me 
                                    thinking? What do they have me becoming? Afterwards, ask yourself if you're good with the answers. Categorize every person you meet. Is he or she someone you should 
                                    disassociate with, have limited association with, or should you expand your association? Surround yourself with winners, people who challenge your thinking capacity,
